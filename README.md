What is Hooks?

Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.

Earlier, when we used to create react app using Functional component, then we did not have access to the state management and lifecycle methods.

To access these features we had to add class components. So this was the problem with functional component.

But after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state management and other react features without writing class components.

In other words, Hooks are the functions that make functional components work like class components.

Hooks made react functional components so easy to use.

Developers prefer functional components over class components.

The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

Some examples of side effects are:

- Fetching data from API
- Directly upating the DOM
- Timers like SetTimeOut and SetInterval

<React.StrictMode> would make its initial rendered twice in main.jsx

useRef is a react hook that allow us to create mutable variables, which will not re-render the component.
